Project Title: SMS Spam Filter Android App
Created by: Sneha Dalvi

Summary:
Spam detection mechanism is implemented using Natural Language Processing(NLP) technique. 
Collected spam keywords from a data set of 5574 spam messages and weight is determined by the frquency.
We check for spam features such as spam keywords, special characters, URL, sender number, etc.
Developed an Android app that -
Detects incoming SMS
Reads the content of SMS
Classifies if the SMS is legitimate or a spam by checking itâ€™s spam features using the spam detection method.
If it is a legitimate SMS, notifies the user and saves the SMS in Inbox
Otherwise, when the app detects the SMS as a spam, it does not notify the user and silently saves the SMS in a file in application folder
